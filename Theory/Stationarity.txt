A stationary time series is one whose properties do not depend on the time at which the series is observed.

- Thus, time series with trends, or with seasonality, are not stationary — the trend and seasonality will affect the value of the time series at different times.
- In general, a stationary time series will have no predictable patterns in the long-term. Time plots will show the series to be roughly horizontal (although some cyclic behaviour is possible), with constant variance.

For eg., a white noise series is stationary — it does not matter when you observe it, it should look much the same at any point in time.
