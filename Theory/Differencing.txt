Suppose a time series is not stationary, but the changes in the values on a daily basis are stationary. 
One way to make a non-stationary time series stationary â€” compute the differences between consecutive observations. This is known as "differencing".

- Differencing can help stabilise the mean of a time series by removing changes in the level of a time series, and therefore eliminating (or reducing) trend and seasonality.
