- We can find the differenced series by finding the change betweeen consecutive observations in the original time series.
-                 y1(t) = y(t) - y(t-1)
- The difference series will have only (T-1) values.
- When the differenced series is white noise, the model can be written as -
-                 y(t) - y(t-1) = e(t)
- where e(t) represents white noise.
- Rearranging the eqaution gives us the random walk model - 
-                 y(t) = y(t-1) + e(t)
