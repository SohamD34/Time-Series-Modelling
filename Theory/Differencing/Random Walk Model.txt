We can find the differenced series by finding the change betweeen consecutive observations in the original time series.
                 y1(t) = y(t) - y(t-1)

The difference series will have only (T-1) values.When the differenced series is white noise, the model can be written as -
                 y(t) - y(t-1) = e(t)
where e(t) represents white noise.

Rearranging the eqaution gives us the random walk model - 
                 y(t) = y(t-1) + e(t)

Closely related model - the mean of ther error values will not be 0. It will be some constant 'c'.
So e(t) = c + e(t).

                 y(t) = y(t-1) + c + e(t)

The value of c is the average of the changes between consecutive observations.
